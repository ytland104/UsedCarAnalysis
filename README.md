# UsedCarAnalysis
python

This GitHub repository describes how to optimize the used car selection process using a data-driven approach. The used car market is rich in information and options, and as a consumer, you want to make your choice as rational as possible. Therefore, the value of using advanced statistical methods such as multiple regression analysis and ridge regression is explored from a practical perspective.

Code in the repository will be based on real market data to show how these advanced techniques can unravel the complexity of the market and improve the validity of purchasing decisions. In addition, multiple predictive models will be implemented to evaluate the effectiveness of each and which model is most informative in a particular situation.

Through this project, users will be able to understand the patterns and insights behind the data and make smarter used car choices based on them. This provides a step toward making solid, empirically based decisions, rather than just a gut feeling.
